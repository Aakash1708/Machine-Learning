Google Play App Rating Prediction 
The goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict app ratings on the Google Play Store. I train the models using a variety of parameters such as category, number of installs, content rating, and more.

Introduction 
  With thousands of apps accessible on the Google Play Store, it can be difficult for consumers to choose which ones to install. App ratings play an important role in this decision-making process. As a result, precisely forecasting app ratings can provide useful data for app developers, marketers, and users alike. 
  
Data Cleaning
  I started by cleaning the dataset, addressing missing values, switching data types, and preparing characteristics to make them ready for analysis and modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  Exploring the dataset provided us with valuable insights into the distribution of various variables and their correlations to app ratings. Visualizations were made to help people understand the data and spot patterns.

Model Training
  Using the cleansed dataset, we trained models for linear regression and artificial neural networks. To predict app ratings, the models were trained using features such as app category, number of installs, price, and more.

Evaluation 
  The performance of the models was assessed using measures such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared score. I also showed the training and validation losses to evaluate model convergence and generalization. 

Conclusion 
  Our models show good results in predicting app ratings using Google Play Store data. Using machine learning techniques, we can deliver useful insights to app ecosystem stakeholders.
